 * Publish guard. Runs from `prepublishOnly`, so it cannot be forgotten.

 * It checks the **packed tarball** and the **git cleanliness of the manifest**,
 * not just the source tree, because the source tree is what lied to us twice:
 *
 *   0.1.1 shipped a `package.json` into which npm had injected ~200 transitive
 *   dev packages as runtime dependencies — a package advertising zero
 *   dependencies that pulled in the whole dev toolchain and failed to install
 *   on Linux. It happened again, from a different npm command, while verifying
 *   0.1.2. Both times the trigger was npm reifying a node_modules tree left out
 *   of sync by an earlier `--no-save` install.
 *
 * Every assertion below corresponds to something that actually went wrong.
